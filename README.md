# IMC Prosperity 2 Challenge 2024 - X-Plorers Team

Round 1:
This round was quite similar to the previous IMC Trading Prosperity challenge competition. It took us quite a while to get familiar with the commands needed to submit a working algorithm. We all got together quite late at night during the university week and tried our best to have some understandable results. 
In the end at the 50hour checkmark we finally had a really bad yet functionning algorithm which we were very satisfied with! The only thing left was to make it a profitable algorithm. 
We used regression modelling to follow the starfruit and amethyst trends, it worked quite well. 
We ranked in the top 120 algorithms for round 1. But our manual trading round brought us down to a global rank of 339 as we had almost completely neglected this part of the competition. We took it as a lesson for future rounds. 

Round 2: 
This was one of Karel and I's favorite rounds. Karel was being active on the discord talking to the community and assessing the benchmark profit for the round (there were a lot of trolls lying about their results). 
A lot of data was given in this round: information about sunlight, humidity, orchids market price, shipping costs, import costs, tariffs etc. 
So for us new algorithmic traders, this was the biggest challenge yet. This round resembled in no way the past rounds given by IMC Trading in the first competition. 

Round 4 Trader: Implementing a Black-Scholes Model 
For round 4, we focused on implementing a proper Black-Scholes model. 
We instantly knew that having information both on the coconut coupons' price movements and the coconut market data itself we could apply a variant of the Black-Scholes model. This round became one of our most profitable ones as our coefficients must have been in the top 20 best to market make.
