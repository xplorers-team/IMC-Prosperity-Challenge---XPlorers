# IMC Prosperity 2 Challenge 2024 - X-Plorers Team

Round 1:
This round was quite similar to the previous IMC Trading Prosperity challenge competition. It took us quite a while to get familiar with the commands needed to submit a working algorithm. We all got together quite late at night during the university week and tried our best to have some understandable results. 
In the end at the 50hour checkmark we finally had a really bad yet functionning algorithm which we were very satisfied with! The only thing left was to make it a profitable algorithm. 
We used regression modelling to follow the starfruit and amethyst trends, it worked quite well. 
We ranked in the top 120 algorithms for round 1. But our manual trading round brought us down to a global rank of 339 as we had almost completely neglected this part of the competition. We took it as a lesson for future rounds. 

Round 2: 
This was one of Karel and I's favorite rounds. Karel was being active on the discord talking to the community and assessing the benchmark profit for the round (there were a lot of trolls lying about their results). 
A lot of data was given in this round: information about sunlight, humidity, orchids market price, shipping costs, import costs, tariffs etc. 
So for us new algorithmic traders, this was the biggest challenge yet. This round resembled in no way the past rounds given by IMC Trading in the first competition. 

Round 3:
The algorithmic trading part was quite difficult as the results 

Our strategy consisted in a hedging spread model where if the spread between the price of a gift basket and the price of the proportion of goods needed for a gift basket was to important compared to the mean, then we would trade based on that spread. This stragegy worked quite well on the backtesting service on huge datasets 


Round 4 Trader: Implementing a Black-Scholes Model 
For round 4, we focused on implementing a proper Black-Scholes model. 
We instantly knew that having information both on the coconut coupons' price movements and the coconut market data itself we could apply a variant of the Black-Scholes model. This round became one of our most profitable ones as our coefficients must have been in the top 20 best to market make. 

Round 5: This round gave us information on the orders made by the bots trading with us from the beginning. We quickly realized that the host of the competition, IMC Trading, wanted to see how we would react if we knew other player's strategies in the market. A first thing we did was backtest every single bots strategies to see if any of them were profitable and we also had to take into account the overall trend of the goods they were trading (a profitable bot whose strategy is long only in a bull trend seemed useless). In the end, we came to the conclusion that the information wasn't of much use to us as every implementation of bots in our strategies reduced our profits in the backtesting service and we weren't ready to take a major gamble this close to the finish line as we wanted to secure the top 100. 
As for the manual trading part, we distributed 90% of the capital after reading the newsreport on the performances of companies. This was my one of my favorite parts of the manual trading challenges as it combined psychology, braingames and sentiment analysis. 


End notes:
Anyways, this was definitely a great competition and we are absolutely participating in the next edition in 2025!
The rollercoaster of having to juggle between academics, holliday trips and having a proper rest as we passionately worked on this project together is unforgettable. 
Many thanks to the amazing community and to IMC Trading for hosting an incredible event for all of us 13500 teams worldwide!
Merci from X-Plorers :)
